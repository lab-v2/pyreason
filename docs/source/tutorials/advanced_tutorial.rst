Advanced Tutorial
==========================================

In this tutorial, we will look at how to run PyReason with a more
complex graph.

Graph
------------

We use a larger graph for this example. In this example , we have ``customers`` , ``cars`` , ``pets`` and their relationships.
We first have ``customer_details`` followed by ``car_details`` , ``pet_details`` , ``travel_details`` .

.. literalinclude:: advanced_graph.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 16-24, 28-34 , 39-52, 58-63

We now have the relationships between the customers , cars , pets and travel details.

.. literalinclude:: advanced_graph.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 67-78

Based on the relationships we now connect the nodes, edges and the form the graph.

.. literalinclude:: advanced_graph.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 84-124

We now have the graph ready. We can now add the rules for our use case. Take a look at it at

Rules
-----

The below are the rules we want to add:

1. A customer is popular if he is friends with a popular customer.
2. A customer has a cool car if he owns a car and the car is of type ``Car_4``.
3. A customer has a cool pet if he owns a pet and the pet is of type ``Pet_2``.
4. A customer is trendy if he has a cool car and a cool pet.

.. code-block:: python

    pr.add_rule(pr.Rule('popular(x) <-1 popular(y), Friends(x,y)', 'popular_pet_rule'))
    pr.add_rule(pr.Rule('cool_car(x) <-1 owns_car(x,y),Car_4(y)', 'cool_car_rule'))
    pr.add_rule(pr.Rule('cool_pet(x)<-1 owns_pet(x,y),Pet_2(y)', 'cool_pet_rule'))
    pr.add_rule(pr.Rule('trendy(x) <- cool_car(x) , cool_pet(x)', 'trendy_rule'))
The above rules are based on nodes. Now let us add some more rules based on the edges.

1. Two customers are ``car_friends`` if they own the same car.
2. Two customers are ``friends`` if they own the same color car.

.. code-block:: python

    pr.add_rule(pr.Rule("car_friend(x,y) <- owns_car(x,z), owns_car(y,z)", "car_friend_rule"))
    pr.add_rule(pr.Rule("same_color_car(x, y) <- owns_car(x, c1) , owns_car(y, c2)","same_car_color_rule"))

Facts
-------

We now add the facts to the graph.
There is only one fact we are going to use.
1. ``customer_0`` is popular from time ``0`` to ``5``.

.. code-block:: python

    pr.add_fact(pr.Fact(name='popular-fact', fact_text='popular(customer_0)', 0, 5))

Running Pyreason
----------------

We now run the PyReason interpretation with the graph and the rules.

.. code-block:: python

    interpretation = pr.reason(timesteps=6)
    # pr.save_rule_trace(interpretation)

    interpretations_dict = interpretation.get_dict()

    df1 = pr.filter_and_sort_nodes(interpretation, ['trendy', 'cool_car', 'cool_pet', 'popular'])
    df2 = pr.filter_and_sort_edges(interpretation, ['car_friend', 'same_color_car'])

Expected Output
---------------
Below is the expected output at timestep ``0``
