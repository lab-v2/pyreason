## 1. Introduction
PyReason is a graphical inference tool that uses a set of logical rules and facts (initial conditions) to reason over graph structures. To get more details, refer to the paper/video/hello-world-example mentioned above.
 
## 2. Documentation 
All API documentation and code examples can be found on [ReadTheDocs](https://pyreason.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## 3. Install
PyReason can be installed as a python library using

```bash
pip install pyreason
```
The Python versions that are currently supported are `3.7`, `3.8`, `3.9`, `3.10`. If you want multi-core parallel support only `3.9` and `3.10` versions work due to limited numba support.
